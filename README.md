# snow_change_mysql

#overview

snow_change_mysql is a simple python based tool to manage all of your mysql objects. It follows an Imperative-style approach to Database Change Management (DCM) and was inspired by the schema change tool(https://github.com/phdata/snowchange) . When combined with a version control system and a CI/CD tool, database changes can be approved and deployed through a pipeline using modern software delivery practices. As such snowchange_mysql plays a critical role in enabling Database (or Data) DevOps.

DCM tools (also known as Database Migration, Schema Change Management, or Schema Migration tools) follow one of two approaches: Declarative or Imperative. For a background on Database DevOps, including a discussion on the differences between the Declarative and Imperative approaches, please read the Embracing Agile Software Delivery and DevOps with Snowflake blog post.
